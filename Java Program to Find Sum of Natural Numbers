ava Program to Find Sum of Natural Numbers
The natural numbers are the numbers that include all the positive integers from 1 to infinity. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ......, n. When we add these numbers together, we get the sum of natural numbers.

In this section, we will create the following programs:

Java program to find the sum of the first 100 natural numbers
Java program to find the sum of n natural numbers
Java program to find the sum of n natural numbers using the function
We can also find the sum of n natural number using the mathematical formula:
##Java Program to Find Sum of Natural Numbers
Sum of n natural numbers=n*(n+1)/2
Suppose, we want to find the sum of the first 100 natural numbers. By putting the value in the above formula, we get:


Java Program to Find Sum of Natural Numbers
In this section, we are going to use the following ways to find the sum of natural numbers.

Using Java for Loop
Using Java while Loop
Using Function
Using Java for Loop
Using Java for loop is the easiest way to find the sum of natural numbers.

SumOfNaturalNumber1.java

public class SumOfNaturalNumber1  
{  
public static void main(String[] args)   
{  
int i, num = 10, sum = 0;  
//executes until the condition returns true  
for(i = 1; i <= num; ++i)  
{  
//adding the value of i into sum variable  
sum = sum + i;  
}  
//prints the sum   
System.out.println("Sum of First 10 Natural Numbers is = " + sum);  
}  
}  
Output:

Sum of First 10 Natural Numbers is = 55
